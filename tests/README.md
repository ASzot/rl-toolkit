# Structure
- Commands under `dev` are under development. 

# Tests
Desired tests to make sure the algorithms are working. Standard environments
indicate "Hopper-v3+Atari".
- PPO,Standard
- A2C,Standard
- REINFORCE,Hopper-v3
- DQN,Atari
- SARSA,Frozen-Lake

- DDPG,Hopper-v3

After they are done training, build an automated report with the training
curves so I can verify the performance. Maybe assign a common group to all the
runs in the report?
